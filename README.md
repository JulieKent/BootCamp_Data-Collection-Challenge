# BootCamp_Data-Collection-Challenge


## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

1. Use automated browsing to visit the [Mars news site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html). Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.

2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.

3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
   * Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. An example is the following:
   ```
   {'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
   'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASA’s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."}
   ```
   * Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
   * Print the list in your notebook.

4. Optionally, store the scraped data in a file (to ease sharing the data with others). To do so, export the scraped data to a JSON file.


## Part 2: Scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data

1. Use automated browsing to visit the [Mars Temperature Data Site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html). Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.

2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table.

3. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. Here’s an explanation of the column headings:
   * id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
   * terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
   * sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
   * ls: the solar longitude
   * month: the Martian month
   * min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
   * pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location

4. Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.

5. Analyse your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
   * How many months exist on Mars?
     
   ![Months](Images/months.png)

   * How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
     
   ![Days](Images/days.png)

   * What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
      * Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
        
      ![Minimum Average Daily Temp](Images/min_avg_temp.png)
     
      * Plot the results as a bar chart.
        
      ![Plot Average Minimum Temp](Images/plot_min_temp.png)
     
      ![Coldest to Warmest](Images/coldest_to_warmest.png)

      ### Analysis - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
       On average, the lowest recorded temperature occurred in the 3rd month at a minimum temperature of -83.3 degrees.  Closely followed by month 4 at -82.7 degrees.  On average, the highest recorded temperature occurred in the 8th month at a minimum temperature of -68.3 degrees.  Closely followed by month 9 at -69.1 degrees.
     

   * Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
      * Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
        
      ![Average Atmospheric Pressures](Images/pressure.png)
     
      * Plot the results as a bar chart.
        
      ![Pressures Lowest to Highest](Images/pressure_low_to_high.png)

      ### Analysis - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
     On average, the lowest atmospheric pressure was recorded in the 6th month with only slightly higher average recordings in the 5th month. Whereas, the highest average recorded atmospheric pressure occurred in the 9th month.

   * About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
      * Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
      * Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
        
      ![Minimum Temp by Day](Images/min_temp_by_day.png)

     ### Analysis - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?
     A rough calculation of the visual difference in the number of days between the peaks (upper peak to upper peak and lower peak to lower peak) in results indicate there are approximately 650 earth days in a Mars year, assuming the results represent seasonal weather changes. 

5. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
